# Welcome to my GitHub! These are my learning records.   
***Thanks for Ma_Cong's suggestion, I will record my project on my home page in the future.  
To prove I have really studied and considered sth about DeepLearning, I will irregularly upload my learning records while reading paper. The host page will only record the project which is very important or recurred by myself.  
Actually, I have several learning reports(PPT) for our group meeting last term. If you'd like to have a see, please turn to https://github.com/USTB-ML/weekly to search them.***
